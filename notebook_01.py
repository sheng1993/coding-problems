# Microservices
# A properly implemented microservices-based application can achieve the following goals:

# Define strong contracts between the various microservices.
# Allow for independent deployment cycles, including rollback.
# Facilitate concurrent, A/B release testing on subsystems.
# Minimize test automation and quality-assurance overhead.
# Improve clarity of logging and monitoring.
# Provide fine-grained cost accounting.
# Increase overall application scalability and reliability.


# HTTP vs HTTPS
# HTTP lacks security mechanism to encrypt the data whereas HTTPS provides SSL or TLS Digital Certificate to secure the communication between server and client.
# HTTP operates at Application Layer whereas HTTPS operates at Transport Layer.
# HTTP by default operates on port 80 whereas HTTPS by default operates on port 443.
# HTTP transfers data in plain text while HTTPS transfers data in cipher text (encrypt text).
# HTTP is fast as compared to HTTPS because HTTPS consumes computation power to encrypt the communication channel.
